Multithreaded Programs Written in C++
=====================================

Introduction
------------

Programs and code samples that I've written in C++ to grasp multithreading and 
concurrency concepts. This is explored by making use of the pthread libraries in 
the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

Installation
------------
Download the zip file, unzip it into a folder, then type in 'make all' to compile
the program. After that you can go ahead and run './program' and you're done.
